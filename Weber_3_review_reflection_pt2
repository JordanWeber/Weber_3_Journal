An array is a list

String[] stringArray = new String[2];

int[][] 2dArray = new int[1][1];

int[][][] 3dArray = new int[1][1][1];

1dArray[2] = 1;

while(true) {
//do stuff here
}

use while loops so that we can keep moving the at sign

start();

if the user says N instead of n, it would break the program if its looking for n, so
.toLowerCase changes the N to a n

if you didnt, there would be no easy way to check if your character interacted with the
enemy

I would pass my position, the enemies position, mine/trap positions, and by making them
static or just passing them as values through the methods
