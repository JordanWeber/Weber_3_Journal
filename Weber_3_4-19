Similarities between assembly and HRM-
HRM had the same basic style of code, as it did all of the
code in a line, unless you told it otherwise, and had very
basic commands to run, such as input, output, and jumps

Differences between assembly and HRM-
Assembly is much more complicated than HRM, as you have to type
very specifically what to do, and actually tell the processor
of the computer what actions to perform. HRM was basically
assembly, but made easier, so that its a one size fits all
assembly program.
