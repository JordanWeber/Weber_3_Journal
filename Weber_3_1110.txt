How can I track what challenges the player has solved?
	By setting up empty booleans and making them true when the player
finishes something
How would I track HP?
	Easy, Just have an Int that starts at 100, and when the player takes
damage, subtract it from the int.
How Would I track items.?
	I would make an object called Inventory and have empty slots for items
that the user couldpick up. each slot wouldmaybe have a string value, and an 
int if its a potion (hp healed) or a weapon (damage it does).
