What is a method?
	A method is a piece of code that can be called from anywhere in the
program and is used to recall pieces of code that would be used multiple
times.

Which methods did I use?
	for the guessing game, I only used the main method becuase it was a 
pretty simple program, but for the method maddness, I used a few methods. 
One for calling the program, another for repeating one method, and another 
to run a for loop over and over to make a checker board.

What is a while loop?
	A while loop is a loop that runs as long as the condition is true.
it is really easy to make while loops that run forever and break code.

How did I use a while loop, boolean, and counter?
	I used a while loop to continue running the program while the user was
playing. I used a counter to make sure the user only had 4 lives. I used a 
boolean to check if the user guessed the right number, and also to check if
the user wanted to play the game again.
