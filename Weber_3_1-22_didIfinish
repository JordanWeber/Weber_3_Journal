I was not able to finish, becuase of my map. At first I tried changing the
file and everything else that worked for other people, but my map wouldn't
work. So in the end all I did was make a map out of the same tiles as the
original d4.tmx, same look, so that I could garuntee that it would work. 
Now im just cramming as much as I can in the last few days to try and get a 
working game.
