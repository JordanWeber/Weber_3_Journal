Am I ready to begin coding my game?
	No, I was set back by helping people and typing for you. Still doing
the Emacs thing
What will be the biggest challenges?
	The biggest challenges, ones that I have tried to tackle before, are
the ones involving an inventory. Finding a place to hold items, and haveing it
function properly was always a challenge of mine.
