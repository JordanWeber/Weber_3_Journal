I don't really have any huge questions about the slick game, since I already knew java
going into this project, it's all just been either refresher for me, or learning the
syntax of slick2D.

I am pretty prepared to polish my slick game. All that I have to actually learn is how to
make an enemy, which I never did, and I am not really sure how to do it. I could either
ask my friends about it, since I know that roeder has a working enemy, but I could also
google it, since google is my friend.
