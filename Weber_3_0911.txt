What is pseudocode?
	Pseudocode is writing down the programs that we think we want to
use in order to organize our thoughts and clearly make a plan to solve the
problem

Why will we use it?
	We will use Pseudocode to make coding more of a planned exercise
rather than just jumping into the problem and possibly wasting time trying
things that wouldn't work.
