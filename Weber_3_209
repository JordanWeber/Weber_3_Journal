how can we make the orb move in the direction we are facing?
-Make a check variable for what direction the player is facing at any time, and set
a variable for the orb to go in that direction when you fire it. in update, have the
position of the orb increase with time.

update(){
orb.setX(player.getX, player.getY + 5);
}
