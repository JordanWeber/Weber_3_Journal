The slick game I will create is a 2D dungeoncrawler where the main objective is to
pick  up gold bars and find the tresure chest. Your points/score are how many golden bars
you collect, and the goal is to get as many as you can, as the game will tell you to
collect more next time.

My biggest issue was getting my map to work.
