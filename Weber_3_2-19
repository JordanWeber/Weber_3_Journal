Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);

-It tells the program where to look and what to grab when making the animation
play

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
-becuase It is all very specific, and we practice problem solving, not memoriztion
What is an array?
-a list of variables
How do you make an array? Give an example.
-int[] numbers = new int[10];
What is an ArrayList?
-an array that can be moved around at anytime.
How do you make an arraylist?
-ArrayList numbers = new ArrayList();
In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):
What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?
What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
-an array cant be moved around once the size has been set, while an array list can.
How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
-int[][] player = new int[5][3];
-player[0][1] = 100;
-The matrix I made would hold many variables, for example:
-player[playernumber][0 = attack damage, 1 = health, 2 = etc.];
